           <h3>Safety First !</h3>
           <img src="warning-electricity-2.gif">
        <p>
          Make sure the computer like any other electrical devices is disconected from the mains before opening !

           <h3>What do these parts do ?</h3>
        <q class="smaller">
          Sometimes it is easier to liken the different components inside a computer to the different parts of a person.
        </q>

        <h3>
          Motherboard - the body

        </h3>
        <p>
   
The motherboard on a computer is the component that everything else connects to. In a sense, it supports all the other components in the computer, supplying them with power it receives from the Power Supply Unit, and provides a means for all the other parts to communicate with each other.

        </p>
<p>
One important part of the motherboard is the BIOS chip.

        <h3>
         Processor (CPU) - the thinking part of the brain
        </h3>
        <p>
   
The processor is most similar to the thinking part of the human brain. It processes the instructions and makes the calculations that are needed by the computer programs we use.
 </p> <p>
The processor “thinks” very hard and generates a lot of heat, so it has a heatsink and cooling fan attached which prevent it overheating and burning out.
.
        </p>

        <h3>
         Memory (RAM) - the remembering part of the brain or 'Short Term Memory'


        </h3>
        <p>
   
To do anything, we all need to remember what it is we are doing now and in the next few minutes. This is our short-term memory. A computer also has short-term memory, called RAM, and it uses this to store all the programs we actively using, and all the information it needs about those programs.


 </p> <p>
So if we are typing a letter, the letter itself and the word processor software we are using are “alive” in the computers short-term memory or RAM. When we switch of the computer, everything in the RAM is completely lost.
        </p>

                        <article>
        <h3>
        Hard drive - a book or 'Long Term Memory'
        </h3>
        <p>
   
If we have too much stuff to remember, we write it down. A computer needs to do the same thing. The contents of it's RAM memory are lost when it is switched off, so a computer needs somewhere to “write down” the things it can't remember.



 </p> <p>
It uses a hard drive for this - a device which can magnetically store huge amounts of information and computer programs. When you switch your computer on, it needs to “read” its hard-drive to “call to mind” what it is, what it can do, and remember the work we have been doing on the computer.
       </p> <p>

Hard drives are connected to the motherboard with an IDE cable.

        <h3>
        CD drive - reference books


        </h3>
        <p>
We can use CDs for storing smaller amounts of information or programs that may be useful to us. These are a bit like reference books to a computer - generally they are for reading from only and not writing in.
 </p> <p>


A CD drive allows the computer to hold and read the contents of a CD.

        <h3>
Power supply (PSU) - heart
        </h3>
        <p>
The power supply connects outside the computer to the mains, and simply passes a reduced electric current to the mainboard and disk drives of the computer.

</p> <p>

So, in a sense, we can liken it to our heart - with electricity being to the computer what blood is to ourselves.

        <h3>
Graphics card - clothes
        </h3>
        <p>
It is hard to compare the graphics card to a part of ourselves!
</p> <p>


The graphics card is a component of the computer which is responsible for creating the display we see on our screens when we are using the computer. Therefore, the best comparison we think we can make is with our clothes. In some ways, we use clothes to present an image of ourselves to other people.
</p> <p>

But there is another function a graphics card performs which doesn't compare so well with clothes. Some graphics cards are capable of sharing the job of the processor in calculating complicated images and scenes.

        <h3>
Speakers - voice box
        </h3>
        <p>
The computer uses the sound card to create sounds and music, so it could be viewed as the computer's voice box!

<p>
        <h3>
Microphone - Ears
        </h3>
        <p>
A microphone allows a computer to hear, some PC' have these built in other need external microphones.
<p>

        <h3>
In humans the mouth and ear are seperate...
        </h3>
        <p>
Most computers have what is known as a 'sound card' this is used to output <b>and</b> input sound
<p>

        <h3>
Case/Chasis - skeleton
        </h3>
        <p>
The case, or box, that everything in the computer fits into is a bit like our own skeleton. It holds all the components together and keeps them a safe distance from each other. It's also a bit like our skin, in that it keeps the components safe from the outside world.
